  "about": {
    "title": "What is Collective Illusion?",
    "subtitle": "Understanding how we misread each other",
    "origin": {
      "title": "How This Project Started",
      "content": "This project was inspired by 'Collective Illusions' by Todd Rose, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. While reading, I kept asking myself: 'Am I falling for these illusions too?' That question led me to create this interactive experience."
    },
    "problem": {
      "title": "What is a Collective Illusion?",
      "content": "A collective illusion occurs when people privately disagree with something but wrongly assume that 'others will agree.' This leads to situations where 'what no one actually wanted' becomes collectively entrenched as if everyone wanted it.",
      "causes": {
        "title": "Why does this happen?",
        "item1": "Our instinct to conform to perceived group norms",
        "item2": "The tendency to stay silent even when we disagree",
        "item3": "The loud minority appearing to represent the majority"
      },
      "quote": "The signals created by the loudest few—strong conviction, aggressive expression, repeated exposure—make their views appear to be the majority opinion, reinforcing the illusion."
    },
    "purpose": {
      "title": "The Purpose of This Project",
      "content": "We unconsciously assume 'others think differently than me.' This project uses real statistical data to show how far off those assumptions can be.",
      "examples": {
        "title": "For example:",
        "item1": "\"I support same-sex marriage, but most others probably oppose it\"",
        "item2": "\"I value meaning over money at work, but everyone else just chases money\"",
        "item3": "\"I think climate change is serious, but there must be more skeptics\""
      },
      "conclusion": "Real statistics often overturn our expectations. Through this experience, we want to convey: 'Don't assume—verify.'"
    },
    "vision": {
      "title": "Where We're Heading",
      "content": "We hope this project becomes more than just a quiz—a small experiment that reveals the 'true distribution' of our society.",
      "goals": {
        "item1": "Individual level: A starting point to shed silence and speak small truths",
        "item2": "Social level: A window to hear the quiet majority, not just the loud minority",
        "item3": "Ultimately: A society that understands each other more accurately and reduces unnecessary conformity"
      },
